A fun tool for making Cards Against Humanity safe to play with your uptight relatives.

My end-goal is to make a configurator to tag and indentify cards that may be offensive to your mother based on her religious and/or political leanings.

For now, the best thing this repo offers is a mysqlite3 database of all the CAH humanity cards and a view of a random hand in the card game.
